# @ayni.org/ayni-ui-core

The framework-independent core of the Ayni UI (`2060-io/ayni-spec`, `v4/ayni-ui`, UI-SHELL-004): agents and
controllers, trust resolution through the Verana indexer, sessions and binding against the
[AG-UI profile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ayni.org/ayni-agui-profile), the conversation reducer, the local store
and sync. The browser UI in this repository and the Ayni app both build on it; nothing in it touches the DOM beyond
`fetch`, `EventSource` and IndexedDB (`idb`).

```sh
pnpm add @ayni.org/ayni-ui-core @ayni.org/ayni-agui-profile
```

Published to npm from this repository by the `npm-publish` workflow whenever `package.json` carries a version that is
not on npm yet.
